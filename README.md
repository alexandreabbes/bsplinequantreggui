# BsplineQuantRegGui

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BsplineQuantRegGui)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BsplineQuantRegGui) [![CRAN downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/BsplineQuantRegGui)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BsplineQuantRegGui) [![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R%3E=4.6-blue.svg)](https://cran.r-project.org/) [![License: GPL-3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL--3-blue.svg)]

## Overview

BsplineQuantRegGui is an interactive Shiny interface for the BsplineQuantReg package, providing a user-friendly way to perform quantile regression using B-splines with shape constraints.

The package is available on CRAN.

The underlying BsplineQuantReg package provides the core regression methods for B-spline quantile regression with Karlin-Studden polynomial sign characterization, including degrees 1 to 4. It provides a small set of robust functions in pure R for polynomial calculation, piecewise polynomial and B-spline manipulation, including differentiation, B-spline coefficients calculations and transformation to PP-form.

## Features

This GUI application makes it easy to:

- Load and visualize data (from multiple data sources: custom function, CSV files)
- Interactive plotting: zoom, pan, and add knots by clicking on the plot
- Configure B-spline parameters (degree 1 to 4)
- Plot multiple curves with color management
- Apply shape constraints (monotonicity, convexity, third derivative)
- Manage constraints per region interactively
- Run quantile regression with various solvers
- Export reproducible R code
- Run demo presets directly from the interface (according to degree)
- Type of regression : quantile or mean-square (for 'BsplineQuantReg' version \>=0.2.3)

## Installation

### From CRAN

```         
install.packages("BsplineQuantRegGui")
```

### From GitHub

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("alexandreabbes/BsplineQuantRegGui")
```

## Quick Start

``` r
library(BsplineQuantRegGui)
# Launch the application
runGui()
```

The GUI will open in your default web browser.

## Docker Deployment

A Docker image is available for easy deployment:

``` bash
docker pull ghcr.io/alexandreabbes/bsplinequantreggui:latest
docker run ghcr.io/alexandreabbes/bsplinequantreggui:latest
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:3838> in your browser.

| ECOSolveR | A good solver that causes no problem to compile |

## Usage Guide

### 1. Data Selection

- Click Test to generate sample data
- Click Temp to load the global temperature dataset (1880-1992)
- Click CSV to import your own data file
- Adjust x range field, the number n of geerated samples
- Use the Custom function field to define your own data generator

### 2. Spline Configuration

- Select Degree (1 to 4)
- Adjust Auto knots count (placed as quantiles of knots)
- Click Add knot to enter manual knot placement mode, then click on the plot. The two lists of knots auto and manual are joined.
- Click Clear knots to clear manual knots
- Click on a knot to select it, click on "remove knot" to remove it.

### 3.Knots multiplicity

-select or un-select "consider multiplicity"" -click on a knot to select it -adjust multiplicity with + or -. Multiplicity of a knot is limited to degree+1

### 3b. View basis

- go to the basis tab
- select or un-select "consider multiplicity"
- Chose a derivative level
- Check the knots and their multiplicities
- click "update basis" to view the Bspline Basis.

### 4. Constraints

- Choose Uniform constraints to apply the same constraint everywhere
- Choose Per region to define different constraints in specific regions
- Click Select to enter region selection mode
- Drag a rectangle on the plot to define the region
- Adjust monotonicity, convexity, and third derivative constraints
- Click Add region to apply the constraint
- View/remove all active region constraints in the Regions tab

### 4. Run Analysis

- Click Run to execute the regression with your chosen solver and type of regression ('BsplineQuantReg' \>= '0.2.3')
- View results: the curve and the Information. Coefficients (on the B-spline Basis)
- View equations of the spline ij pp form in a human readable form
- View derivatives and check the constraints
- View verbose output in the Console tab if verbose = TRUE is selected
- Informations: Degree, tau, constraints, knots and coefficients
- Data: Summary and table of the data

### 4b Reproduce analysis by your own

- R Code tab: Generated code to reproduce the analysis

### 4c Check output in console

- select "verbose" to print verbose aoutput in the console tab.

### 5. Run Demos

Click on any demo to run it. The degree of the spline is that selected in the GUI.
